This tool helps you add funds to your WatCard easily. I wrote this tool because I am too lazy to do it by hand everytime.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install fund-my-watcard
```

## Usage

```
teachertian@v1040-wn-rt-c-83-249 ~/PycharmProjects/fundmywatcard: watcard
usage: watcard [-h] [-c | -f FUND | -v | -e | -d | -r]

Fund my WatCard: A tool that add funds to your WatCard easily.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --config          generate the config file
  -f FUND, --fund FUND  the amount to add into the WatCard
  -v, --version         show the version of fund-my-watcard
  -e, --encrypt         encrypt the config file with user defined password
  -d, --decrypt         decrypt the config file so you can edit it
  -r, --reset           reset the config file
  -t, --transactions    review the previous transactions
```

One important step before funding is to fill the config file **.watcard_config**, which is generated and stored under the user directory. Type `watcard --config` to initialize and edit the config file.

An example of **.watcard_config**:

```json
{
  "userName": "WatIAM username",
  "password": "WatIAM username",
  "ordName": "Name on the credit card",
  "phoneNumber": "Phone number",
  "address1": "Home address 1",
  "address2": "Home address 2 (Blank if no address2)",
  "ordPostalCode": "Postal code",
  "ordCity": "City",
  "ordEmailAddress": "Email address",
  "paymentMethod": "Payment method ('CC' for 'Credit Card')",
  "trnCardOwner": "Card owner",
  "trnCardType": "Card type ('VI' for 'Visa', 'MC' for 'Master Card', see more card types below)",
  "trnCardNumber": "Card number",
  "trnExpMonth": "Expiry month",
  "trnExpYear": "Expiry year",
  "trnCardCvd": "Card CVD (3 digit number on the back of the card)",
  "encrypted": "False"
}
```

An example of filled **.watcard_config**:

```json
{
  "userName": "s123zhang",
  "password": "1234567",
  "ordName": "San Zhang",
  "phoneNumber": "123 456 7890",
  "address1": "123 Queen Street West",
  "address2": "",
  "ordPostalCode": "A1B2C3",
  "ordCity": "Waterloo",
  "ordEmailAddress": "zhangsan@gmail.com",
  "paymentMethod": "CC",
  "trnCardOwner": "San Zhang",
  "trnCardType": "MC",
  "trnCardNumber": "1234567890123456",
  "trnExpMonth": "01",
  "trnExpYear": "25",
  "trnCardCvd": "123",
  "encrypted": "False"
}
```

Payment Method should be **CC** (Credit Card). Do not support **Interac Online**.

Card Type can be **MC** (Mastercard), **VI** (Visa), **PV** (VISA Debit), **MD** (Debit Mastercard) or **AM** (AMEX).

After filling the config file, try `watcard --fund 10` to add 10 dollars to your account. At the next time, no need to edit config file (unless you want to change some information), just use `watcard --fund` to fund your watcard easily, cheers!

## Docker Image

We also maintain a docker image for fund-my-watcard:

https://hub.docker.com/r/faushine/fund-my-watcard

Pull image from docker-hub: 
   
```bash
 docker pull faushine/fund-my-watcard:0.3.1
 ```

Create and edit `.watcard_config` (There is a template of `.watcard_config` in the folder `docker`, you may want to edit it directly). 

Run container and mount configuration to the container:
   
```bash
docker run -it  -v /absolute/path/of/.watcard_config:/root/.watcard_config faushine/fund-my-watcard:0.3.1
```
